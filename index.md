# CHDOLLAR
 CHDollar Programming Language  is a modern Programming Language consists of JAVA OOPS, C# OOPS,  Behave like 
 CDOLLAR OOPS, GDOLLAR OOPS,used in Remote  WebApplication , and Advanced  OOPs. It  is  mainly  used  as a   Remote Webappilication.
 It is used in case of Billing,Forms ,normal  remotewebapplication ,   CH$-GRAPHICS ,and complex problems.
 
 ABOUT CHDOLLAR Programming Language
---------------------------------------------------
It is concenterated in building and designing Advanced Operating systems.
CH$ is invented in GDollar in year 2008.
CH stands for GAMMA and dollar stands for money.
So we called as GAMMA Technology.

 Merits of CH$
 ===============
> It is Good to create any compilers..and Advanced Operating systems and utilities.
> It has simpilified code
> it uses Pointers concept.
> CH$ also used with C@ and Arrow# in mobile and cloud computing.
>  it  is     learnable  ,easy  to use, and   let  developer s to  focus  only   java,c++
or  C#  Programming  Language
>  CH$  also    support   CHDOLLARAJAX
>  it  can  be  used  with   JAVA  framework   lik  java spring ,hibernate.

Disadvantages
==============
> It  is   used  to  build   normal  remote  webapplication
> absence   of   framework in  CH$ .

CHDOLLAR   has  only   2  pillars  which is  present  in SRGX   and jittechsection1

a).chdollar(simillar to java and C++ combination)  called  as  CWEB.
b) CHDollar-JAVA (cross  compiler)  simillar  to  Core JAVA  called  as  GWEB.

How Chdollar Technology Works?  Or  chdollar  workflow?
––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––-
At first .chdollar is compiled by remoteserver  usign  CDC  compiler.
chdollar  has  inbuilt  chdollar-java (CDC) compiler
And which  translates to  (bytecode) .class  file 
or  which  accepts  .dll  file  and  convert  to  .exe  file.
This   CDC  compiler   is  divided  into  two  parts  
a)  accept  corejava  concepts
b)  accept  C# oops  concepts ,  CDollar  or  GDollar  oops  concepts  
remotserver  also  executes .exe or  .class  file.
so  java programmers  or C#  programmers   can  use  it.  
shortly  when   client   send  a  request  to  a  remotserver  ;
 remotserver   accepts  CH$  code and  process  the   request   
     and  print    the output  generated  by CDC  compiler  by 
 using chdollar   JAVA  runtime.


Note:chdollar project is started at google code and it is modified at github.
