# CHDOLLAR
 CHDollar Programming Language  is a modern Programming Language consists of JAVA OOPS, C# OOPS,  Behave like 
 CDOLLAR OOPS, GDOLLAR OOPS,used in Remote  WebApplication , and Advanced  OOPs. It  is  mainly  used  as a   Remote Webappilication.
 It is used in case of Billing,Forms ,normal  remotewebapplication ,   CH$-GRAPHICS ,and complex problems.
 
 
  
  What   is  the  difference   between Remotewebapplicationserver  and  webserver?
  ================================================================================
  
  Definition:  Remote  webserver  application    is   an  application    operates    with
  ============
  
  client-server.but  it  will  post  and  get  objects   from  server that  can  be
  
  exchanged through out  sessions.
  
  
  eg)  When  you enter   details  using  CH$  program  that   creates   a   data  object
  
  called  as .dsn  file;  that can  be  exchanged  through  out   sessions.
  
  Difference  between   webserver  and  remoteserver  means   remotserver  

has   remote-client  connection  but  webserver don't have.

Data flow  is  unknown   using  J$  architecture.  where   as  in   

webserver  and  application server  like  tomcat,JSTAR SERVER,Jboss server,  etc;  here  dataflow  is  known.

JSTAR  webserver   is used   only   for  webdesign  so   we  don't  focus   remoteserver.

In webserver  data  will   be   sent  between  client(browser)  and  server

is  known  to users.

so  this   indicates   webserver   has  no  security  but  remoteserver  using  J$  architecture

has  more   security  according  to  research.

Remoteserver   uses http +  socket  connection    where   as webserver uses   only  http  connection

Remote web  application server  =>  webserver  +  Applicationserver +  datasecurity.

So J$ is  most  advanced in  security   side. but  it  has  more  framework  and  latest technology

and  follows  shortest  code    than  any  technology and  including  advanced  business and  many  advantages

over  other  technologies.

 
 ABOUT CHDOLLAR Programming Language
---------------------------------------------------
It is concenterated in building and designing Advanced Operating systems.
CH$ is invented in GDollar in year 2008.
CH stands for GAMMA and dollar stands for money.
So we called as GAMMA Technology.

 Merits of CH$
 ===============
> It is Good to create any compilers..and Advanced Operating systems and utilities.
> It has simpilified code
> it uses Pointers concept.
> CH$ also used with C@ and Arrow# in mobile and cloud computing.
>  it  is     learnable  ,easy  to use, and   let  developer s to  focus  only   java,c++
or  C#  Programming  Language
>  CH$  also    support   CHDOLLARAJAX
>  it  can  be  used  with   JAVA  framework   lik  java spring ,hibernate.

Disadvantages
==============
> It  is   used  to  build   normal  remote  webapplication
> absence   of   framework in  CH$ .

CHDOLLAR   has  only   2  pillars  which is  present  in SRGX   and jittechsection1

a).chdollar(simillar to java and C++ combination)  called  as  CWEB.
b) CHDollar-JAVA (cross  compiler)  simillar  to  Core JAVA  called  as  GWEB.
 

SYNTAX FOR CHDOLLAR (.chdollar) (beautiful syntax)

How Chdollar Technology Works?  Or  chdollar  workflow?
––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––-
At first .chdollar is compiled by remoteserver  usign  CDC  compiler.
chdollar  has  inbuilt  chdollar-java (CDC) compiler
And which  translates to  (bytecode) .class  file 
or  which  accepts  .dll  file  and  convert  to  .exe  file.
This   CDC  compiler   is  divided  into  two  parts  
a)  accept  corejava  concepts
b)  accept  C# oops  concepts ,  CDollar  or  GDollar  oops  concepts  
remotserver  also  executes .exe or  .class  file.
so  java programmers  or C#  programmers   can  use  it.  
shortly  when   client   send  a  request  to  a  remotserver  ;
 remotserver   accepts  CH$  code and  process  the   request   
     and  print    the output  generated  by CDC  compiler  by 
 using chdollar   JAVA  runtime.


Note:chdollar project is started at google code and it is modified at github.
