Or  chdollar  workflow?\r\n––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––-\r\nAt first .chdollar is compiled by remoteserver  usign  CDC  compiler.\r\nchdollar  has  inbuilt  chdollar-java (CDC) compiler\r\nAnd which  translates to  (bytecode) .class  file \r\nor  which  accepts  .dll  file  and  convert  to  .exe  file.\r\nThis   CDC  compiler   is  divided  into  two  parts  \r\na)  accept  corejava  concepts\r\nb)  accept  C# oops  concepts ,  CDollar  or  GDollar  oops  concepts  \r\nremotserver  also  executes .exe or  .class  file.\r\nso  java programmers  or C#  programmers   can  use  it.  \r\nshortly  when   client   send  a  request  to  a  remotserver  ;\r\n remotserver   accepts  CH$  code and  process  the   request   \r\n     and  print    the output  generated  by CDC  compiler  by \r\n using chdollar   JAVA  runtime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
